                  <p class="subtitle">Time to collect the world!</p>
                  <p>
                    I started work on our player inventory system this week and have completed the prototype version, it will be redfined and added to as development continues as need be. This proved to be quite an interesting task to take on as first we needed to decide how players would collect items, how do we want to store this data and how can we keep track of it in the game itself. To begin we decided to follow suit with games such final fantasy and monster hunter world where once over the item you can hit a button to interact with and pickup the item from the ground. To make the item more noticable during development I threw on a small particle generator to act as a beacon for the item, from here we moved onto the storage and class of the item. There are many ways to go about this but I decided to take the approach of using scriptable objects and saving them to json and loading them back to the inventory when necessary.
                  </p>

                  <p>To access the inventory screen, we would need to be able to pause the game so that was logically my next step. I designed a rough UI for both pause menu, setting menu and the inventory screen. This proved to be quite the task of making it so the player can use items, this involved making the item scriptable object into an abstract class to build more item types up. We ensured that we kept developing the game with the use of a controller in mind which led to a redesign of the input manager to allow us to have multiple interactions depending on the context of the players location or game state.</p>

                  <p>For the next stage of development, I have begun a redesign of our attack system to allow for more variety in play style and as well to be more forgiving than the previous implementation we had which was a very small hitbox for the player to actually hit anything. This new system should be a great addition to the character and will probably take longer than originally thought as we need to also look into the animations of the game for blending attacking and running together so you dont have to keep stopping to attack. I plan on showing off another video of the character's progress in next week's blog post so be sure to check back next week to see how its going!</p>

                  <p class="title">Main Character Development - #2</p>
                  <p class="subtitle">The beginning of the adventure!</p>
                  <p>
                    This week I've been mainly focusing on the development of the main character prototype, this encompasses components such as movement, animation, attacking and sensing. We've decided to use Unity's newest Input system in Unity 2019.3 which is a preview package and while there has been a bit of a learning curve to using it, it does remind me of the SteamVR 2.0 action system which I have used in a previous project. This event driven system is great for a action, adventure game as when the button is hit we can map it to call a particular method, however I can see a few issues down the line we may have but my remedy to this is to create an input manager that should solve any issues.
                  </p>

                    </video>
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>As you can see from the video above, I've got the basics for movement completed, this includes, walking, running, crouching as well as the same actions while having a weapon equipped and active. I will admit that I was thinking about checking for the ground under the player in a rather complex way when there was a much simpler way that was more than suitable for the job, it took about a day and a half of development time from me but I've leanred from it. The next step after this was to setup the animation controller as I planned to use unity's animation events alongside my attack script for sheathing and unsheathing your sword.</p>

                  <p>
                    The coup de gr√¢ce of the the new Input System in Unity 2019.3 however is the ability to properly map button input for controllers in a simple way that allows you to use multiple control schemes from the very start of development. For instance, I've been using a PS4 dualshock for testing and debugging as well as swapping to mouse and keyboard if I want to see how it handles the swapping of controls and in the past week, I've learned quite a few little tricks in Unity that I wasn't aware of before such as animation events, attaching gameobjects to another object through the use of SetParent() without it causing strange scaling issues.
                  </p>

                                    
                  <p>
                    The next step on the road to our fully complete main character protoype is the development of an inventory and equipment system which I already have begun on, so check in next week to see further progress and hopefully the completed main character prototype!

                  <p class="subtitle">Welcome to the development blog for Project Crescent!</p>
                  <p>
                    Project Crescent is a 3D action RPG game with a modern fantasy setting being developed in the Unity game engine. This development blog will help you keep up to date with the progress of the project as well as document the journey from the first day of development to its eventual release. The game will be released on the Itch.IO marketplace in the summer of 2020 and the whole team is excited to get to work on the project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To give a little insight into the development process, we began by writing up design documents, project scope and mechanic documents to give us a better idea of what we want the game to become and how to divide up our time to reach our goals. Using the Kanban agile methodology, we created a backlog of features and systems that we would need to develop and impliment. Now we are ready to begin the development journey and get to work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In regards to the story, we don't want to reveal anything at the moment as we don't want to spoil the game for anyone and it's also likely to change in some areas as we develop the game and brain storm more on how it should play out. We hope you'll come back and check out the projects progres as we continue to build the game, there will be weekly blog posts so feel free to pop by and take a gander.
