                  <p class="subtitle">The item wheel goes round and round!</p>
                  <p>
                    Continuing on from last weeks post (technically earlier this week), I've moved onto giving the inventory/equipment system an overhaul as it doesn't have the functionality needed for the ability tree to be implimented completely. I also wanted to add in an item wheel to allow the player to quickly use items during battle without having to pause the game mid-battle, my item wheel system instead slows down time to let the player to pick the item they need while still keeping in the flow of the battle. The next step of action is to redo the inventory screen to allow the player to set items on the item wheel to specific slots and also sort out the item types in the inventory, currently all items are just in a simple list, instead I hope to have them broken into sections which the player can cycle through using the shoulder buttons. To accomplish this task I will use the button state system I've mentioned in a previous dev post to let the player cycle, the menus will be broken down into consumables, weapons and baubles (accessories) and may be expanded in the future.

                  <p>
                    Due to the last post only being a few days ago, I don't have much else to add in this development post as I'm trying to get back to posting on Fridays and Saturdays. Next weekends blog post should have more work mentioned it as well as a few screenshots to demonstrate the various inventory overhauls. Make sure to check back next weekend!

                  <p class="subtitle">We're back and ready to throwdown!</p>
                  <p>
                    This weeks blog post from myself was delayed by a couple of days because I wanted to finish up overhauling our players attack system, the previous system I had implimented meant that the player could only use the provided sword and the animations for it were sloppy not to mention that all the player could do was a simple slash. This new system allows for the creation of new weapons with ease in the Unity editor itself and all thats needed are a model and any specific weapon animations, this new system will also allow for us to quickly change out the player's weapon for a variety of other weapons, instantly increasing the players oppurtunities to find a play style that suits them to a tee. Another nice little change to the attack system is that the player can now dodge roll and will have invincibility frames while rolling to allow them to dodge enemy attacks, I hope to smoothen out the transitions from player states to each other nearer the end of development but for the time being it works for testing purposes.
                  </p>

                    </video>
                  </p>

                  <p>There has also been a lot more going on then just the attack overhaul however, after working on more functionality for the attack, I realised it was time to setup an input manager to work in tandem with Unity's latest input system to allow for our controls to change their functionality depending on the context of the player's situation. For example when a player is standing over an item, the Square button on a PS4 dualshock becomes pickup item rather than a dodge roll, each button has a context system to allow us to further expand on the possibilities of what the player can do. The new input manager also allows us to bind multiple actions to a key, for example a quick tap of the Square button will allow the player to dodge roll but if they hold the button for a second then they will sheath their weapon.</p>

                  <p>As I stated in my previous post I had planned to fix up the players animations and make them much smoother as their was some instances of the players feet sliding all over the ground when they attacked as can be seen in the previous video, it took a few days but after diving into the animation tools in Unity, I was able to start piecing together our animation system together and make it much neater and modular than it had been before. I was also able to smooth out some transitions and prevent the player's feet from sliding wildly across the floor, some other changes were made in regards to the player's actual animations such as the landing animation and a few other small bits and pieces.</p>

                  <p>Moving forward, I plan to work on the ability tree for the player and also to give the inventory system a minor overhaul and that should finish up the basis of the player mechanics for the being. Make sure to check back next weekend for another update on Project Crescent!</p>

                  <p class="subtitle">What's in a Quest?</p>
                  <p>
                    This week and last, I have been generating ideas for a Quest Management System. This consists of an overall manager to check and set active Main Scenario Quests (MSQ) and Side quests. The quests themselves each have individual steps that combine to achieve your questing goals.  When thinking back to quests in the many games Iâ€™ve played over the years, and most notably Final Fantasy XIV Online, each step can have different types of goal. This might be talking to a specific NPC, collecting a target number of items, killing a few enemies, or some combination thereof.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    For this reason, I decided to abstract the QuestStep class, and allow for 4 child classes: Location, NPC, Quantity and Multi-Quantity. Each of these will have different behaviour, but each will share a description and isCompleted, and in much the same way Ronan abstracted the itemObj class, these will be scriptable objects to allow easy creation in the Unity editor when it comes time to piece the game together.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This all came from thinking about how NPCs will talk, what they will say and when they will say it. A lovely flow chart gives the sense of how this will happen, mostly being contextualised by the current quest(s) the player has active at a given time. 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Next week should see further implementation of the Quest system, and hopefully see some NPCs having a chat with the player. Watch this space!

                  <p class="subtitle">Time to collect the world!</p>
                  <p>
                    I started work on our player inventory system this week and have completed the prototype version, it will be redfined and added to as development continues as need be. This proved to be quite an interesting task to take on as first we needed to decide how players would collect items, how do we want to store this data and how can we keep track of it in the game itself. To begin we decided to follow suit with games such final fantasy and monster hunter world where once over the item you can hit a button to interact with and pickup the item from the ground. To make the item more noticable during development I threw on a small particle generator to act as a beacon for the item, from here we moved onto the storage and class of the item. There are many ways to go about this but I decided to take the approach of using scriptable objects and saving them to json and loading them back to the inventory when necessary.
                  </p>

                  <p>To access the inventory screen, we would need to be able to pause the game so that was logically my next step. I designed a rough UI for both pause menu, setting menu and the inventory screen. This proved to be quite the task of making it so the player can use items, this involved making the item scriptable object into an abstract class to build more item types up. We ensured that we kept developing the game with the use of a controller in mind which led to a redesign of the input manager to allow us to have multiple interactions depending on the context of the players location or game state.</p>

                  <p>For the next stage of development, I have begun a redesign of our attack system to allow for more variety in play style and as well to be more forgiving than the previous implementation we had which was a very small hitbox for the player to actually hit anything. This new system should be a great addition to the character and will probably take longer than originally thought as we need to also look into the animations of the game for blending attacking and running together so you dont have to keep stopping to attack. I plan on showing off another video of the character's progress in next week's blog post so be sure to check back next week to see how its going!</p>

                  <p class="subtitle">The beginning of the adventure!</p>
                  <p>
                    This week I've been mainly focusing on the development of the main character prototype, this encompasses components such as movement, animation, attacking and sensing. We've decided to use Unity's newest Input system in Unity 2019.3 which is a preview package and while there has been a bit of a learning curve to using it, it does remind me of the SteamVR 2.0 action system which I have used in a previous project. This event driven system is great for a action, adventure game as when the button is hit we can map it to call a particular method, however I can see a few issues down the line we may have but my remedy to this is to create an input manager that should solve any issues.
                  </p>

                  <p >
                    <video width="320" height="240" controls class="center">

                    </video>
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>As you can see from the video above, I've got the basics for movement completed, this includes, walking, running, crouching as well as the same actions while having a weapon equipped and active. I will admit that I was thinking about checking for the ground under the player in a rather complex way when there was a much simpler way that was more than suitable for the job, it took about a day and a half of development time from me but I've leanred from it. The next step after this was to setup the animation controller as I planned to use unity's animation events alongside my attack script for sheathing and unsheathing your sword.</p>

                  <p>
                    The coup de grÃ¢ce of the the new Input System in Unity 2019.3 however is the ability to properly map button input for controllers in a simple way that allows you to use multiple control schemes from the very start of development. For instance, I've been using a PS4 dualshock for testing and debugging as well as swapping to mouse and keyboard if I want to see how it handles the swapping of controls and in the past week, I've learned quite a few little tricks in Unity that I wasn't aware of before such as animation events, attaching gameobjects to another object through the use of SetParent() without it causing strange scaling issues.
                  </p>

                                    
                  <p>
                    The next step on the road to our fully complete main character protoype is the development of an inventory and equipment system which I already have begun on, so check in next week to see further progress and hopefully the completed main character prototype!

                  <p class="subtitle">Welcome to the development blog for Project Crescent!</p>
                  <p>
                    Project Crescent is a 3D action RPG game with a modern fantasy setting being developed in the Unity game engine. This development blog will help you keep up to date with the progress of the project as well as document the journey from the first day of development to its eventual release. The game will be released on the Itch.IO marketplace in the summer of 2020 and the whole team is excited to get to work on the project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To give a little insight into the development process, we began by writing up design documents, project scope and mechanic documents to give us a better idea of what we want the game to become and how to divide up our time to reach our goals. Using the Kanban agile methodology, we created a backlog of features and systems that we would need to develop and impliment. Now we are ready to begin the development journey and get to work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In regards to the story, we don't want to reveal anything at the moment as we don't want to spoil the game for anyone and it's also likely to change in some areas as we develop the game and brain storm more on how it should play out. We hope you'll come back and check out the projects progres as we continue to build the game, there will be weekly blog posts so feel free to pop by and take a gander.
