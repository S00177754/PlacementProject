    * ************************************************
    * Adding Quests and Steps
    * 
    * Convention is to number quests as such;
    * 
    * Main Scenario:        MSQx
    * Main Scenario Step:   MSQxSx
    * 
    * Side Quest:           SQx
    * Side Quest Step:      SQxSx
    * 
    * This will sort the Quests and Steps in order 
    * in the Project viewer in Unity for easier 
    * tracking when creating.
    * 
    * Quest ID should be the same as the above codes,
    * but Name can be displayed as anything.
    * 
    * QuestManager should be populated as you go
    * for clarity.
